Error: No such table: lessons_lesson, or something similar:
Fix: Stop running the server, then try deleting all initial.py migrations in all the apps, then delete
the sqlite3 database, then run "python manage.py makemigrations", then run "python manage.py migrate",
then try running the server again. If that still does not work, try
"python manage.py migrate --run-syncdb".

To check details of SQL migrations:
"python manage.py sqlmigrate myapp 0001_initial"
